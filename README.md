# GettingCleaningData

# The training and the test data sets are merged (including the different labels and subject numbering)
# in the merging step, the variable names are already renamed to more descriptive labels (see task 4)
# then all the variables with mean or standard deviation are filtered
# the activity labels are used for better understanding
# a data set with the averages of all variables (from the previous step) per subject and activity is created
# last data set is exported as csv file
